# gym-app-WinForms
Win Forms App intended to storage  gym's information(Personal info about competitor/ Personal Record)

Why I did this? 
I created this for storing information about competitor from my team. I may looking for competitor for second name, showl all competitor, check competitor from list or create ranking.

What I learned ?
I learned using Dapper to connect to SQL, created connection string in config file, using connection string witch helper class(Helper.cs),data access from data base with Dapper.


I want to improve the application with the possibility of adding new competitor from applications level, sending email to new competitor(someting like "welcome in our team") witch FluentEmail and public ranking in WWW or generatex excel file with rank.
